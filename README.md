Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you can find some projects that I'm trying to do. 

Maybe later I'll upload some projects to [this awesome organisation](https://github.com/HikkaAndProgrammer), but now I'm doing my personal projects. 

What I am going to do now: [Virtual Machine, written in C](https://github.com/AlmiriQ/LIVM), [Visual Novel engine]() and maybe something else, I dont really remember...

My language skills:
+ Great - C (f2019y, see my project LIVM), Lua (f2019y, used in LIVM, Maria Arusu bot and other small scripts), Java (f2021y, I finished Samsung IT-school)
+ Well - Python (f2019y, +pygame, I used it for some small scripts and physics simulation (bad expirience)), Kotlin (f2021y, Android, no published projects, but I tryed to make music player and android launcher (INDEV)), Pascal ABC (I learned it in school and then I used it to make a small keylogger)
+ 50/50 - JS (Web+Node - I can make a simple JS webpage), SQL (We learned this thing in Samsung IT-school and I use it sometimes)
+ "I can read & understand this" - Ruby (I was learning it for fun, but not used it), C# (one of my freinds uses it, so I know something from that lang)
+ "What is this?" - C++ (I don't understand this syntax and things like multiinteritance)
