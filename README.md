Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you can find some projects that I'm trying to do. 

Maybe later I'll upload some projects to [this awesome organisation](https://github.com/HikkaAndProgrammer), but now I'm doing my personal projects. 

What I am going to do now: [Virtual Machine, written in C](https://github.com/AlmiriQ/LIVM), [Visual Novel engine]() and maybe something else, I dont really remember...

My language skills:
+ Great - C (f2019y, I now am writing VM in C), Lua (f2019y, I use it for small scripts and have made a discord bot), Java (f2021y, I finished Samsung IT-school)
+ Well - Python (f2019y, +pygame), Kotlin (f2021y, Android), Pascal ABC (I learned it in school and then I used it to make keylogger)
+ 50/50 - JS (Web+Node), SQL
+ "I can read & understand this" - Ruby (I was learning it for fun, but not used it), C#
+ "What is this?" - C++ (I don't understand this syntax and things like multiinteritance)
