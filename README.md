Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you can find some projects that I'm trying to do. 

Maybe later I'll upload some projects to [this awesome organisation](https://github.com/HikkaAndProgrammer), but now I'm doing my personal projects. 

My language skills:
+ Great - C (f2019y, now going to study in School21), Lua (f2019y, Maria Arusu bot and other small scripts), Java (f2021y, I finished Samsung IT-school, also Floating Arusu is Java-based (or just based idk)), JS (Web|Node - I just love JS)
+ Well - Python (f2019y, +pygame, I used it for some small scripts and physics simulation (bad expirience)), Kotlin (f2021y, Android, no published projects, but I tryed to make music player and android launcher (INDEV)), Pascal ABC (I learned it in school and then I used it to make a small keylogger)
+ 50/50 - SQL (We learned this thing in Samsung IT-school and I use it sometimes)
+ "I can read & understand this" - Ruby (I was learning it for fun, but not used it), C# (one of my freinds uses it, so I know something from that lang), Haskell (this one I learned using language model as my teacher)
+ "What is this?" - C++ (I don't understand this syntax and things like multiinteritance)
